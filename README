BooBoo Quick CA
===============

This is my collection of scripts for
   * setting up a Certificate Authority (CA)
   * creating Client and Server Certificates from it
   * sign Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)

It is designed for everybody who quickly needs to setup a CA,
e. g. to use it
   * for an OpenVPN or
   * for a Webserver granting access to its applications like a webmailer
     only after authenticating with a client certificate

It covers only the most common usecases of X.509 certificates. (If you
have special usecases or need to issue certificates daily, you might
want to look for some different solution.)
On the other hand BooBoo Quick CA can be set up in less than 5 minutes and
issue first certificates immediately.


Installation
------------

First of all: Decide where to run your CA.
For less critical usecases you might want to use some existing workstation
or server. For a more secure setup, maybe use a separate RasPI or something
like this which is not connected to any network and stored in a safe place
most of the time.

In any case: Create a separate user for your CA.
Switch to this user and e. g. in the home directory do a

   git clone https://github.com/booboo-at-gluga-de/booboo-quick-ca.git

if we assume you want to live your CA in ~/booboo-quick-ca
If you like some other directory, use

   git clone https://github.com/booboo-at-gluga-de/booboo-quick-ca.git ~/path/to/ca-dir


Setup your CA
-------------

Switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and use

   bin/setup_CA.sh

answer y(es) to the question it asks.
On first run, it creates the config file

   ca_config/booboo-quick-ca.cfg

Edit this file and change the settings according to your needs. All settings
have comments there. Afterwards again start the setup script

   bin/setup_CA.sh

Now it will create your CA certificate and (if you told so) your Issuing CA
certificate.


Issue Certificates
------------------

The absolutely most easy way for issuing certificates is to use the
create_customer_cert.sh script. It does everything for you:

   * create a key pair
   * create a CSR
   * sign it
   * provide the issued certificate in the wanted formats
     (PEM is always created; DER, PKCS12 and JKS if you did not deselect
     them in booboo-quick-ca.cfg)

To use it switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and type

   bin/create_customer_cert.sh -h

to display the help screen explaining all command line options.


Sign CSRs
---------

A more secure way - most IT security experts agree - to create X.509
certificates is if the secret key never leaves the target system.

For using this way:

   * create the key pair and the CSR directly on the target system
     (the system where you want to use the certificate) e. g. by using
     openssl commands like
         openssl genrsa -aes256 -out <CERT_KEY_FILE> 2048
         openssl req -key <CERT_KEY_FILE> -new -sha256 -out <CSR_FILE>
   * send the CSR to the CA
   * use the sign_customer_cert.sh script there to create the certificate

Switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and use

   bin/sign_customer_cert.sh -h

to display the help screen explaining all command line options.


Revoke a certificate
--------------------

To revoke a certificate you issued, switch to your CA user, change to your
CA directory and use

   bin/revoke.sh -f <cert_file>

To revoke your Issuing CA certificate, switch to your CA user, change to your
CA directory and use

   bin/revoke.sh -i

For more infos refer to the help screen displayed by

   bin/revoke.sh -h


Renew CRL(s)
------------

Only if you decided to use Certificate Revocation List(s) - CRL(s) by setting
ROOT_CA_CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS and maybe ISSUING_CA_CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS
in booboo-quick-ca.cfg to non empty value(s) you need to renew your CRL(s)
regularly, because they have a limited validity period (by default: 30 days).

To renewy your CRL(s) switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and
use

   bin/renew_crl.sh

To check validity period only - without renewing the CRL(s) - use

   bin/renew_crl.sh -c

For help use

   bin/renew_crl.sh -h


Renew Issuing CA
----------------

If you did your setup with a separate Issuing CA (which is the default)
your Issuing CA typically has a shorter livetime than your Root CA. So at
one point you will have to renew your Issuing CA.

To do this switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and use

    bin/setup_CA.sh -i


Display csr, pem, der, jks or pkcs12 files
------------------------------------------

To display the content of different, SSL/TLS related file types just use

    bin/show_ssl_file.sh <FILE> [<FILE>]+

You do not need to care about, which type (csr, pem, der, jks or pkcs12)
the files are: show_ssl_file.sh tries to determine the type and display
the content in an appropriate way.

For detailed info see

    bin/show_ssl_file.sh -h


Update BooBoo Quick CA to a new version
---------------------------------------

Updating to the latest version of BooBoo Quick CA is very easy.
Switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and use

   git pull

It updates all files delivered from the git. It does not touch your config
files or the certificates you already created.


Create more than one CA
-----------------------

The most convenient way for setting up more than one Certificate Authority
(CA) on one machine is to clone the git repo into a different directory
(see section Installation above) and use it there. This way you can also
create a differnt user for each CA you are running.


Re-Setup your CA
----------------

After e. g. setting up your first CA and playing around with it a lot
you may decide now to setup your "real" CA. Therefor you might want to
remove your previous files.

Switch to your CA user, change to your CA directory and use

   rm -Rf ca_certs ca_config ca_private_keys crl csr customer_certs customer_private_keys tmp

This keeps the binaries of BooBoo Quick CA, but removes all the certificates
and config files created before.
Jump to section "Setup your CA" now.
