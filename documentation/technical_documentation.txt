Technical Documentaion for BooBoo Quick CA
==========================================

Things one needs to understand how BooBoo Quick CA works are documented
primarily using comments in the scripts and config files itself.
Everything else you find below.


Testing Certificates within a SSL/TLS Connection
------------------------------------------------

If it is not enough for your usecase to just verify a certificate against
your CA, you might want to establish a real SSL/TLS Connection between
two processes. You can achieve this for example by

    # create a certificate for your host
    bin/create_customer_cert.sh -n $(hostname -f)

    # in one terminal you start a server process
    openssl s_server -port 8443 -cert customer_certs/$(hostname -f).$(date +%Y-%m-%d).cert.pem -key customer_private_keys/$(hostname -f).$(date +%Y-%m-%d).key.pem

    # from a second terminal you connect against the server
    echo '########## this should appear in server window ##########' | openssl s_client -verify_return_error -verify 3 -CAfile ca_certs/ca_chain_plus_crl.cert.pem -connect $(hostname -f):8443

    # alternatively in the second terminal you can use curl to connect to the server
    curl --cacert ca_certs/ca_chain.cert.pem --max-time 2 https://$(hostname -f):8443/
    # do not care about a message like
    # curl: (28) Operation timed out after 2001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
    # that's ok, because our dumb server does not send a response
    # important for this test case is only not to get a certificate warning
