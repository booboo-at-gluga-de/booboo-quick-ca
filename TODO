 * if issuing a client certificate, maybe we want to put users eMail
   address into the email field too (not only in the CN field)
 * script for renewing issuing ca
 * move CUSTOMER_CERT variables for path settings into the config file
 * always give the CN as SAN too (some browsers expect this)
 * create_customer_cert.sh should get params to set subject alternate
   names (SANs)
 * add a script for signing CSRs generated by customers somewhere different
 * add a script for revoking certificates
 * create_customer_cert.sh: add a parameter for giving more SAN names
 * find out how not to ask for CN when creating the CSR but set it directly
   (otherwise if the users enters an different name within the dialog
   we have differences between CN and first SAN)
